The following project connects scenes created in Factory.io, such as a processor connected to conveyor belts. The next step is to select the items by color, and finally, they are moved to a pick-and-place mechanism that transports them to their final location. The RSLogix 5000 code uses best practices, including add-ons to better structure lines and reuse code from other projects. A YouTube link and code screenshots will be provided separately for better understanding.
